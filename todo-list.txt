Misha's Git To-Do List:

1. make this file
2. commit changes, which I think will need -am?
3. make more changes, and commit... will I still need -a?
4. this is a practice lab from Flatiron School
5. I should really have a README, but this is only a lab
6. Delete all the labs I don't want in my portfolio, eventually.
